## Installation

### Install globally to use as CLI tool

`yarn global add rev-dep`

or

`npm -g install rev-dep`

### Install in project to use as a module

`yarn add rev-dep`

or

`npm install rev-dep`

## Example

For this repo

```sh
rev-dep resolve getDepsSet.js cli.js
```

will output

```
Results:

 ‚ûû cli.js
  ‚ûû find.js
   ‚ûû getDepsSet.js
```

Which says that `getDepsSet.js` file is used in `cli.js` entry point and is required through `find.js`

## About

The tool was created to determine places in the project where a particular file is used, to test wether the refactoring do not break functionalities.

It's especially useful in JS world without TypeScript or tests coverage.

Except the reverse dependency resolution path, it can print statistics about how many times a particular module is required in the project, which might be helpful for code-splitting planning.

## Usage

Project can be used as a CLI tool or as a regular JS module

### CLI Tool

Avaliable commands:

#### `resolve`

```sh
rev-dep resolve <filePath> <entryPoints...>
```

Available options are

- `-cs or --compactSummary` - instead of file paths print a compact summary of reverse resolution with a count of found paths
- `--verbose` - log currently performed operation
- `-wc, --webpackConfig <path>` - path to webpack config to enable webpack aliases support

### Module

#### `find` Function

```js
import { find } from "rev-dep";

const path = find({
  entryPoints: ["index.js"],
  filePath: "utils.js",
});

console.log(path);
```

#### `find` Options

- `entryPoints (Array)` - Array of entry points to build a tree for search. Usually it will be one entry point, but project can have many of them, eg. next.js application. **Required**
- `filePath (String)` - A file that we want to find path for. **Required**
- `skipRegex (String | RegExp)` - If a file path matches the pattern, we stop to traverse it's dependencies and do not include that file in the search tree. _Optional_, default: `'(node_modules|/__tests__|/__test__|/__mockContent__|.scss)'`
- `verbose (Boolean)` - when set to true, will print current operation performed by find function. _Optional_, default: `false`
- `cwd` - root for resolved files, must be an absolute path. _Optional_, default: `process.cwd()`
- `webpackConfig (String)` - path to webpack config to enable webpack aliases support

### Additional setup may be required

#### Resolving implicit file extensions

A vast amount of JS/TS projects are configured in a way that allows (or even forces) to skip file extensions in import statements. Rev-dep is strongly based on [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) which by default support implicit file extensions for `*.js, *.cjs, *.mjs, *.jsx` files (check [source](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/blob/96e34d0cf158034f2b7c8cafe9cec72dd74d8c45/src/extract/transpile/meta.js)).
In order to resolve implicit extensions for other JS based languages it look for available corresponding compiler in `package.json`. If compiler is available, then extension is supported.

If you installed `rev-dep` **globally**, you will have appropriate compiler installed **globally** as well. If you use it as a module, your project has to have compiler in it's package.json.

For example, to support `*.ts` and `*.tsx` implicit extensions in globally installed `rev-dep`, you have to also install globally `typescript` package (see [source](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/blob/96e34d0cf158034f2b7c8cafe9cec72dd74d8c45/src/extract/transpile/typescript-wrap.js))

## CLI reference

<!-- cli-docs-start -->

### Command `resolve`

Checks if a filePath is required from entryPoint(s) and prints the resolution path

#### Usage

```sh
rev-dep resolve <filePath> [entryPoints...] [options]
```

#### Arguments

- `filePath` - Path to a file that should be resolved in entry points (**required**),\* `entryPoints...` - List of entry points to look for file (_optional_)

#### Options

- `-wc, --webpackConfig <path>` - path to webpack config to enable webpack aliases support (_optional_)
- `--cwd <path>` - path to a directory that should be used as a resolution root (_optional_)
- `-rr --reexportRewire <value>` - resolve actual dependencies for "export \* from" statements (_optional_)
- `-i --include <globs...>` - A list of globs to determine files included in entry points search (_optional_)
- `-e --exclude <globs...>` - A list of globs to determine files excluded in entry points search (_optional_)
- `-cs, --compactSummary` - print a compact summary of reverse resolution with a count of found paths (_optional_)
- `-a, --all` - finds all paths combination of a given dependency. Might work very slow or crash for some projects due to heavy usage of RAM (_optional_)

### Command `entry-points`

Print list of entry points in current directory

#### Usage

```sh
rev-dep entry-points [options]
```

#### Options

- `-wc, --webpackConfig <path>` - path to webpack config to enable webpack aliases support (_optional_)
- `--cwd <path>` - path to a directory that should be used as a resolution root (_optional_)
- `-rr --reexportRewire <value>` - resolve actual dependencies for "export \* from" statements (_optional_)
- `-i --include <globs...>` - A list of globs to determine files included in entry points search (_optional_)
- `-e --exclude <globs...>` - A list of globs to determine files excluded in entry points search (_optional_)
- `-pdc, --printDependenciesCount` - print count of entry point dependencies (_optional_)
- `-c, --count` - print just count of found entry points (_optional_)

### Command `files`

Get list of files required by entry point

#### Usage

```sh
rev-dep files <entryPoint> [options]
```

#### Arguments

- `entryPoint` - Path to entry point (**required**)

#### Options

- `-wc, --webpackConfig <path>` - path to webpack config to enable webpack aliases support (_optional_)

- `-rr --reexportRewire <value>` - resolve actual dependencies for "export \* from" statements (_optional_)
- `-c, --count` - print only count of entry point dependencies (_optional_)

### Command `docs`

Generate documentation of available commands into md file.

#### Usage

```sh
rev-dep docs <outputPath> [options]
```

#### Arguments

- `outputPath` - path to output \*.md file (**required**)

#### Options

- `-hl, --headerLevel <value>` - Initial header level (_optional_)

## Contributing

Project is open to contributions, just rise an issue if you have some ideas about features or you noticed a bug. After discussion we can approach implementation :)

## Development

1. Clone repo
2. Install deps using `yarn`
3. Run tests using `yarn test --watch`
4. Code!

For testing purpose you can install CLI tool from the file system using

`yarn global add file:ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_REPO`

or just

`yarn global add file:$(echo $PWD)`
